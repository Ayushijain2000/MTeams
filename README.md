## AGILE METHODOLOGY FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
 
 ### **Sprints**
 
I divided my work in various sprints:

 **1.Designing Phase :** It included designing the wire frame and some User Interface of my website and code too.

**5.Code performance and User Experience:** I improved the UI and UX with the help of friends and family. I checked my code performance too.

### **Development Practices**

**1.Maintaining Agile Board :** Agile board helped me plan, visualize and mange my work through the project.
![Agile Board](https://ik.imagekit.io/48vhb7pknty/Screenshot_2021-07-12_at_4.49.34_PM_Ut-WgHGTU.png)

**2.CI/CD And TDD :** Continuous Integration and delivery along with Test driven Development helped me in continuous integration and bring down defects in code.

![CI/CD 2](https://ik.imagekit.io/48vhb7pknty/Ci_cd_2_jS0nBqIMR.jpeg) 

**3.Code In Extensible Modules :** Writing code  as extensible module made it easier to design  
understand and test.

**FOLDER STRUCTURE**

I designed my code as extensible modules.

- The server code is present in the `root` folder of the project,
- Then i made different folders for different files

   - `public` folder 

      - `css` folder: It contained the front end of the project.

      - `js` folder: It contains all the js files and back end part of the project.

      - `utils` folder
         - `homeImg` folder: It contains all the imgaes of the landing page.
         - `images` folder: It contains the images of the video calling page.

   - `test` folder: It contained the testing files.

   - `views` foler: It contains all the ejs files of the project.


## INSTALLATION

For development, you will only need Node.js, a node global package and npm installed on the machine.

You can find more information about the Node.js installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

1. Download the code from here

   ![Nodejs]()

2. Open the project in your preferable `editor` and open the `terminal`. There you can see the `package.json` file.

3. cd into the project.

4. write the following in the `terminal`:
   
   ``` Javascript

    npm install
    npm install -g nodemon
    nodemon app.js 

   ```
  you can also use node app.js instead of nodemon app.js , but it is preferred to use nodemon app.js _(nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server)_
