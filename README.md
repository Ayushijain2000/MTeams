### **Development Practices**

**1.Maintaining Agile Board :** Agile board helped me plan, visualize and mange my work through the project.
    
   <br>

   <br>
   <br>
    
**2.CI/CD And TDD :** Continuous Integration and delivery along with Test driven Development helped me in continuous integration and bring down defects in code.

   <p>
    
   <br>
   <br>
    

**3.Code In Extensible Modules :** Writing code  as extensible module made it easier to design  
understand and test.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE
   <br>
    
I designed my code as extensible modules.

- The server code is present in the `root` folder of the project,
- Then i made different folders for different files

   - `public` folder

    - `css` folder: It contained the front end of the project.

    - `js` folder: It contains all the js files and back end part of the project.

    - `utils` folder
     - `homeImg` folder: It contains all the imgaes of the landing page.
     - `images` folder: It contains the images of the video calling page.

   - `test` folder: It contained the testing files.

   - `views` foler: It contains all the ejs files of the project.

## INSTALLATION
<br>
    
For development, you will only need Node.js, a node global package and npm installed on the machine.

You can find more information about the Node.js installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

1. Download the code from here

   ![Nodejs]()

2. Open the project in your preferable `editor` and open the `terminal`. There you can see the `package.json` file.

3. cd into the project.

4. write the following in the `terminal`:
   
   ``` Javascript

   $ npm install
   $ npm install -g nodemon
   $ nodemon app.js 

   ```
  you can also use node app.js instead of nodemon app.js , but it is preferred to use nodemon app.js _(nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server)_
